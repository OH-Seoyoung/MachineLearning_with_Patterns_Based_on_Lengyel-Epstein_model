# MachineLearning with Patterns Based on Lengyel-Epstein model
- In scientific computing lab, this is my first machinelearning project.

## Dataset
- Patterns in Lengyel-Epstein model created by MATLAB.


## Process
1. Chemical prepattern and reaction-diffusion models for pigmentation  
    : Lengyel-Epstein equation in 1D with MATLAB  
      
2. Creating the pattern images(2D) based on Lengyel-Epstein model with MATLAB  
    : To classify 3 dissimilar patterns through a Neural Network  
      
3. Gradient Descent  
  
4. Single-Layer Neural Network with Softmax  
  
5. CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)  
    : Performance of CNN is tremendous, but I want to increase the performance of the single-layer neural network.  
      
6. Gradient feature in affine layer  
  
7. Adam regularization  
  
8. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)  
    : I don't think this will help reduce over-fitting.  
I realized that the number of training data can affect accuracy.  
  
9. Compare 10 cases  
    : When classifying images that are not similar, the accuracy of 9th model was good. But not in similar images.  
      
10. Classification of all patterns   
    : I thought that similar patterns are mathematically the same ones thus 9th model can't classify it.  
      
11. Complex Pattern in a simple system  
    : Pearson's Classification of Gray-Scott System Parameter Values  
      
12. Clustering - k-means    

## Conclusion
### 1. Classification

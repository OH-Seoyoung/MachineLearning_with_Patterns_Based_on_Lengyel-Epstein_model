# MachineLearning with Patterns Based on Lengyel-Epstein model
- In scientific computing lab, this is my first machinelearning project.

## Dataset
- Patterns in Lengyel-Epstein model created by MATLAB.


## Process
__1. Chemical prepattern and reaction-diffusion models for pigmentation__ 
    : Lengyel-Epstein equation in 1D with MATLAB
__2. Creating the pattern images(2D) based on Lengyel-Epstein model with MATLAB__  
    : To classify 3 dissimilar patterns through a Neural Network  
__3. Gradient Descent__
__4. Single-Layer Neural Network with Softmax__
__5. CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)__  
    : Performance of CNN is tremendous, but I want to increase the performance of the single-layer neural network.
__6. Gradient feature in affine layer__
__7. Adam regularization__  
__8. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)__  
    : I don't think this will help reduce over-fitting.
+ I realized that the number of training data can affect accuracy.  
__9. Compare 10 cases__  
    : When classifying images that are not similar, the accuracy of 9th model was good. But not in similar images.
__10. Classification of all patterns__  
    : I thought that similar patterns are mathematically the same ones thus 9th model can't classify it.
__11. Complex Pattern in a simple system__  
    : Pearson's Classification of Gray-Scott System Parameter Values
__12. Clustering - k-means__

## Conclusion
### 1. Classification

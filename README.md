# MachineLearning with Patterns Based on Lengyel-Epstein model
- In scientific computing lab, this is my first machinelearning project.

# Dataset
- Patterns in Lengyel-Epstein model created by MATLAB.

# Process
- 1. Chemical prepattern and reaction-diffusion models for pigmentation 
  : Lengyel-Epstein equation in 1D with MATLAB
- 2. Creating the pattern images(2D) based on Lengyel-Epstein model with MATLAB
- 3. Gradient Descent
- 4. Single-Layer Neural Network with Softmax
- 5. Gradient feature in affine layer
- 6. Adam regularization
- 7. Compare 10 cases
- 8. Complex Pattern in a simple system
  : Pearson's Classification of Gray-Scott System Parameter Values
- 9. Clustering
